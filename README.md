Introduction:
Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental for any programmer striving to become proficient in problem-solving and software development. 
This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of common data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.

Data Structures:

Linked Lists: Implementation of singly linked lists and doubly linked lists
Stacks: Implementation of a stack data structure.
Queues: Implementation of a queue data structure.
Trees: Implementation of binary search trees and balanced trees (AVL trees).
Graphs: Implementation of graph data structures and algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).

Algorithms:

Sorting Algorithms: Implementation of various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.
Searching Algorithms: Implementation of linear search, binary search, etc.
Dynamic Programming: Implementation of dynamic programming algorithms for solving problems like the Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, etc.
Graph Algorithms: Implementation of algorithms for traversing and manipulating graphs, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, etc.
